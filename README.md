## Problem

It is inefficient to manually screen one's watchlist on a timely basis. Further, it is almost impossible to manually screen all the stocks in shorter timeframes.
Lastly, there is a huge chance of missing out on a great opportunity by the time one is manually able to screen the stocks.

## Solution

Computers being faster than humans, Screenr aptly accompanies a trader by itself screening a huge watchlist on a relatively shorter timeframe.
Screenr has algorithms to detect major candlesticks and chart patterns over live market feed.
Screenr also calculates the major Technical Indicator values and tells whether the indicator signals a Bullish Trend or a Bearish Trend.
Screenr is coupled with a user-alert system wherein whenever a desired signal is encountered, it alerts to user via an email.
